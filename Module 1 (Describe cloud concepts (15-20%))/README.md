# Module 1
## Describe cloud concepts (15-20%)

### Cloud Computing

1. Compute Power - Servers such as windows, linux, hosting environmens, etc.
2. Storage - files, databases
3. Networking - Network in Azure, or connecting to Azure or your company's network
4. Analytics - Services for visualization and other data

### Cloud Concept

Scalability - the ability to scale, can ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE resources at any time
Elasticity - the ability to DYNAMICALLY scale
Agility - the ability to scale QUICKLY based on demand
Fault tolerance - the ability to maintain the UPTIME while physical and service component failures happen
Disaster recovery - the process and design principle which allows a system to RECOVER from nautral or human induced disasters
High availability - the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. A calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.
* availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)

### Economies of Scale

The principle of economies of scale states that as the companies grow they become more effective at managing shared operations.
* As company becomes bigger, they save/earn more reduced cost of their services: discounts, bundle, partnership. This is called PRICE PER UNIT

### CapEx vs OpEx

Capital Expenditure
* Initial up front cost
* Pay taxes over time
* Low ongoing cost
* No early termination
* Heavy maintenance
* Loses value over time

Operational Expenditure
* No up front cost
* Pay based on usage of resource
* Pay taxes in the same year
* Can terminate service at any time
* Low maintenance
* No change in value over time

### Consumption-based model

A pricing model that is used in cloud so that customers are only charged based on their resource usage
* No associated upfront cost
* No wasted resources. Resources are spun up based on need and can be terminated if not used

Consumption - a virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource in Azure was used. 

### Service Models responsibilities

1. Software as a Service (SaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
4. On-prem
